Hi, I'm @Linovert.
My name is Alexei Blinov. I am a graduate from The University of Toronto; I received an Honours Bachelor of Science degree with High Distinction - majoring
in computer science with an emphasis on computer security.
I am interested in front-end development, software development in general, and robotics.
I plan to learn .NET, Vue.js, C++, AWS, SQL Server, and Oracle SQL soon.
Currently, I do not know what is out there to collaborate on.
How to reach me: My email is blinovalexei97@gmail.com

Feel free to give pointers on my development projects and request to join, and contribute.
